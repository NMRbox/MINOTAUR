# MINOTAUR

MINOTAUR (Matching INtensities to Optimize the Timescales and AmplitUdes of motions from Relaxometry) aims at analyzing high-field accurate NMR relaxation rates together with relaxometry intensity decays recorded under shuttling conditions to yield an accurate description of the dynamic properties of the system under study.
